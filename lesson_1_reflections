reflections lesson 1
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

it helped me by showing all the lines with differences, making very easy to find the error

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

if i make any modification to the code and it stops working correctly the i can see previus vertions to see the differences and find the mistake a lot faster

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros

you can choose when to make commit, for coding this is great for a doc not so mucho if you forget to commit you may
lose the hole document

automatically save in coding doesnt seen too smart because woukd be hard tiknow when to commit. commit when you add each char or a line? its dificult to know, but for a document save each time you add a word is not bad

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because in coding the changes in diferent files are probably related to a single functionality

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

with log yi can list all commits and with diff i can see de different between each other

this is a test
